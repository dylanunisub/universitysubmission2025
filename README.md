# Data Processing & Sentiment Analysis (Databricks Notebooks)

This repository contains my submission showcasing exploratory work with **Apache Spark** on **Databricks**.  
The notebooks demonstrate data ingestion, processing, and sentiment analysis using Python in a distributed environment.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Since the code was written and executed in **Databricks**, some functionality may not run as expected in a normal text editor or local environment without Spark/Docker/Databricks setup.
